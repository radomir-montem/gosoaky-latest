To know if your jacket can be put in the dryer, you can consult the care label in the jacket, as that differentiates with every jacket. Please never use bleach, as that will cause damage to the fabric and waterproofness, and we don’t want that! Most items are made of a waterproof fabric that is additionally treated with a water repellent finish so moisture drops off the fabric. After you’ve loved your GOSOAKY for a while the finish might need a boost and we recommend to treat the jacket with our Organotex X GOSOAKY Water Repellent Spray so you can love your GOSOAKY longer.</p>",

The height of the water says something about the amount of pressure the fabric can withstand before the water will penetrate the fabric. That is how Water Column Pressure is measured. So, a Water Column Pressure of 20K means that the fabric can withstand 20.000 mm of water pressure.</p>",
